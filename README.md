# Electric-vehicle-EVs-Data-Analysis
The Report
In the beginning I had data about Electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington That have no meaning so I started to ask some questions about the data that could help extract and explore information that would help understand the data.
But before that I did some operations in the data to help me to analyze it accurately:
1-Understand the data
2- clean the data ‘by power query’
Then I asked these questions:
What is the most electric vehicle type used by customers in WA?
What are the top 5 most sold brand of cars in WA?
What is the improvement over the years for owning EVs? and when did the trend happen?
What is the most county that have EVs? 
How many vehicles are eligible for clean alternative fuel? to determine how much people tend to save nature
Then started to extract their answers from pivot table and design the data graphs in a dashboard for easy communication and ease of the information as well.
